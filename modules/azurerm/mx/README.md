# DSF MX
[![GitHub tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/imperva/dsfkit.svg)](https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tags)

This Terraform module provisions a DSF Management server (AKA mx) on Azure as a virtual machine instance.

Impervaâ€™s Management Server is the manager for DAM components. This includes Agent Gateways and Agents.

## Requirements
* Terraform, refer to [versions.tf](versions.tf) for supported versions.
* An Azure account.
* Network access to port 8083 (API and WebConsole)
* Configure programmatic deployment for the desired version of Imperva DAM by [enabling it on the relevant image from the Azure Marketplace](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/LegalTermsSkuProgrammaticAccessBlade/legalTermsSkuProgrammaticAccessData~/%7B%22product%22%3A%7B%22publisherId%22%3A%22imperva%22%2C%22offerId%22%3A%22imperva-dam-v14%22%2C%22planId%22%3A%22securesphere-imperva-dam-14%22%2C%22standardContractAmendmentsRevisionId%22%3Anull%2C%22isCspEnabled%22%3Atrue%7D%7D). For DAM LTS version, use [DAM LTS Azure Marketplace image](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/LegalTermsSkuProgrammaticAccessBlade/legalTermsSkuProgrammaticAccessData~/%7B%22product%22%3A%7B%22publisherId%22%3A%22imperva%22%2C%22offerId%22%3A%22imperva-dam-v14-lts%22%2C%22planId%22%3A%22securesphere-imperva-dam-14%22%2C%22standardContractAmendmentsRevisionId%22%3Anull%2C%22isCspEnabled%22%3Atrue%7D%7D).

**NOTE:** In case you are not yet an Imperva customer, [please contact our team](https://www.imperva.com/contact-us/).

## Resources Provisioned
This Terraform module provisions several resources on AWS to create the DSF MX. These resources include:
* A virtual machine instance for running the software.
* A security group to allow the required network access to and from the DSF instance.
* An Azure network interface.

The virtual machine provide the computing resources needed to run the DSF Management server. The security group controls the inbound and outbound traffic to the instance.


## Inputs

The following input variables are **required**:

* `resource_group`: Resource group to provision all the resources into
* `subnet_id`: The ID of the subnet in which to launch the DSF instance
* `ssh_key`: ssh details
* `mx_password`: MX password
* `secure_password`: The password used for communication between the Management Server and the Agent Gateway
* `dam_version`: Version must be in the format dd.dd.dd.dd where each dd is a number between 1-99 (e.g 14.10.1.10)
* `license`: DAM license file path. Make sure this license is valid before deploying DAM otherwise this will result in an invalid deployment and loss of time

Refer to [variables.tf](variables.tf) for additional variables with default values and additional info.

## Outputs

Refer to [outputs](outputs.tf) or https://registry.terraform.io/modules/imperva/dsf-mx/azurerm/latest?tab=outputs

## Usage

To use this module, add the following to your Terraform configuration:

```
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

module "mx" {
  source                       = "imperva/dsf-mx/azurerm"
  resource_group               = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id                    = azurerm_subnet.example.id
  ssh_key = {
    ssh_private_key_file_path = var.ssh_key_path
    ssh_public_key            = var.ssh_public_key
  }
  mx_password                  = var.mx_password
  dam_version                  = var.dam_version
  license                      = var.license
}
```

To see a complete example of how to use this module in a DSF deployment with other modules, check out the [examples](../../../examples/) directory.

We recommend using a specific version of the module (and not the latest).
See available released versions in the main repo README [here](https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit#version-history).

Specify the module's version by adding the version parameter. For example:

```
module "dsf_mx" {
  source  = "imperva/dsf-mx/azurerm"
  version = "x.y.z"
}
```

## API Access
API access is required to provision this module. Please make sure to pass the relevant CIDR block, representing your workstation, to allow such access through the `allowed_web_console_and_api_cidrs` variable.
