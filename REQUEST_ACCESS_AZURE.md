# Request access to DSF installation software on Azure

Impervaâ€™s Data Security Fabric product, aka DSF, consists of four sub-products:
1. DSF Hub and Agentless Gateway (formerly Sonar)
2. DAM MX and Agent Gateway
3. DRA Admin and Analytics 
4. DAM Agent audit source for POC purposes

The following links allow you to request access to the installation software of the three subproducts for the Azure account where you want to deploy DSF.

Following your request, you are automatically granted access after a period of time specified in each link.

**Clarification**: After the DSF installation files are copied, configure the relevant terraform variables and run eDSF Kit.
