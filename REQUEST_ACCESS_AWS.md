# Request access to DSF installation software on AWS

Imperva’s Data Security Fabric product, aka DSF, consists of four sub-products:
1. DSF Hub and Agentless Gateway (formerly Sonar)
2. DAM MX and Agent Gateway 
3. DRA Admin and Analytics 
4. DAM Agent audit resource for POC purposes

The following 3 links allow you to request access to the installation software of the three subproducts for the AWS account where you want to deploy DSF.

Following your request, you are automatically granted access after a period of time specified in each link.

When deploying to multiple AWS accounts, use multiple forms.

**Clarification**: After getting the requested access, you don’t have to “download” the software, just run eDSF Kit.
