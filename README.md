# Getting Ready to Deploy

## Choosing the Deployment Mode

DSFKit offers several deployment modes:

* **CLI Deployment Mode:** This mode offers a straightforward deployment option that relies on running a Terraform script on the deployment client's machine.

  For more details, refer to [CLI Deployment Mode](#cli-deployment-mode).
* **Terraform Cloud Deployment Mode:** This mode makes use of Terraform Cloud, a service that exposes a dedicated UI to create and destroy resources via Terraform.
  This mode is used in cases where we don't want to install any software on the deployment client's machine. This can be used to demo DSF on an Imperva AWS Account or on a customer’s AWS account (if the customer supplies credentials).

  For more details, refer to [Terraform Cloud Deployment Mode](#terraform-cloud-deployment-mode).
* **Installer Machine Deployment Mode:** This mode can be used if a client machine is not available or DSFKit cannot be run on it. In this mode, the deployment is done via a DSFKit Installer Machine on AWS. This dedicated machine acts as a “bastion server”, and the user only needs to create an EC2 machine and run the Terraform on it. This mode has two options:
   * Manual: The user manually creates the EC2 machine.
   * Automated: The user runs a Terraform script which automatically creates the EC2 machine.

  For more details, refer to [Installer Machine Deployment Mode](#installer-machine-deployment-mode).

The first step in the deployment is to choose the deployment mode most appropriate to you.
If you need more information to decide on your preferred mode, refer to the detailed instructions for each mode [here](#deployment).

## Prerequisites

Before using DSFKit to deploy DSF, it is necessary to complete the following steps:

1. Create an AWS User with secret and access keys which comply with the required IAM permissions (see [IAM Role section](#iam-roles)).
2. The deployment requires access to the tarball containing the Sonar binaries. The tarball is located in a dedicated AWS S3 bucket owned by Imperva. 
   Click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnVaw48FlElP9Po_36LLsZELsanzpVnt8J08nymBqHuX_ddA/viewform) to request access to download this file.  
3. Only if you chose the [CLI Deployment Mode](#cli-deployment-mode), download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
4. Only if you chose the [CLI Deployment Mode](#cli-deployment-mode), download Terraform [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads). It is recommended on MacOS systems to use the "Package Manager" option during installation.
5. Only if you chose the [Terraform Cloud Deployment Mode](#terraform-cloud-deployment-mode), it is required that you have access to a Terraform Cloud account. Any  account may be used, whether the account is owned by Imperva or the customer. 
   Click [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgJh4kXYRD08xDsFyYgaYsS3ebhVrBTWvntcMCutSf0kNV2w/viewform) to request access to Imperva's Terraform Cloud account.


**NOTE:** It may take several hours for the access to be granted to AWS and Terraform Cloud in Steps 2 and 3.

## Choosing the Example/Recipe that Fits Your Use Case

An important thing to understand about the DSF deployment, is that there are many variations on what can be deployed, 
e.g., the number of Gateways, with or without HADR, the number of VPCs, etc.

We provide several of out-of-the-box Terraform recipes we call "examples" which are already configured to deploy common DSF environments.
You can use the example as is, or customize it to accommodate your deployment requirements.

To see the available examples, refer to [Out-of-the-box Examples](#out-of-the-box-examples).

If you are familiar with Terraform, you can go over the example code and see what it consists of.
The examples make use of the building blocks of the DSFKit - the modules, which can be found in the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/search/modules?namespace=imperva&q=dsf-">Imperva Terraform Modules Registry</a>. As a convention, the DSFKit modules' names have a 'dsf' prefix.

If you need help choosing or customizing an example to fit your use case, please contact [Imperva Technical Support](https://support.imperva.com/s/). 

## Sonar Binaries Location and Versioning

When using DSFKit there is no need to manually download the DSF binaries, DSFKit will do that automatically based on the Sonar version specified in the Terraform example recipe.

**For example**: examples/poc/basic_deployment/variables.tf
   ```terraform
   variable "sonar_version" {
       type    = string
       default = "4.10"
   }

   >>>> Change the Sonar version to the one you want to install
   ```

Make sure that the Sonar version you are using is supported by all the modules which are part of your deployment.
To see which Sonar versions are supported by each module, refer to the specific module's README. 
(For example, [Hub module's README](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/imperva/dsf-hub/aws/latest))

# Deployment 

After you have [chosen the deployment mode](#choosing-the-deployment-mode), follow the step-by-step instructions below to ensure a successful deployment. If you have any questions or issues during the deployment process, please contact [Imperva Technical Support](https://support.imperva.com/s/).

## CLI Deployment Mode

This mode makes use of the Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI) to deploy and manage environments.
Terraform CLI uses a bash script and therefore requires a Linux/Mac machine.

The first thing to do in this deployment mode is to [download Terraform ](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

**NOTE:** Update the values for the required parameters to complete the installation: example_name, aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key and region

1. Download the zip file of the example you've chosen (See the [Choosing the Example/Recipe that Fits Your Use Case](#choosing-the-examplerecipe-that-fits-your-use-case) section) from the <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.3.6">DSFKit GitHub Repository</a>, e.g., if you choose the "basic_deployment" example, you should download <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.3.6/examples/poc/basic_deployment/basic_deployment.zip">basic_deployment.zip</a>.

2. Unzip the zip file in CLI or using your operating system's UI.
   For example, in CLI:
   ```bash
   unzip basic_deployment.zip
   
   >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
   ```

3. In CLI, navigate to the directory which contains the Terraform files.
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd basic_deployment
   
   >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
   ```

4. Optionally make changes to the example's Terraform code to fit your use case. If you need help doing that, please contact [Imperva Technical Support](https://support.imperva.com/s/).


4. Terraform uses the AWS shell environment for AWS authentication. More details on how to authenticate with AWS are [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).  \
   For simplicity, in this example we will use environment variables:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${access_key}
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${secret_key}
    export AWS_REGION=${region}

    >>>> Fill the values of the access_key, secret_key and region placeholders
    ```

5. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
6. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

   This should take about 30 minutes.


7. Extract the web console admin password and DSF URL using:
    ```bash
    terraform output "dsf_hub_web_console"
    ```
8. Access the DSF Hub by entering the DSF URL into a web browser. Enter “admin” as the username and the admin_password as the password outputted in the previous step.

**The CLI Deployment is now complete and a functioning version of DSF is now available.**

## Terraform Cloud Deployment Mode

This deployment mode uses the Terraform Cloud service, which allows deploying and managing deployments via a dedicated UI. Deploying the environment is easily triggered by clicking a button within the Terraform interface, which then pulls the required code from the Imperva GitHub repository and automatically runs the scripts remotely. 

This deployment mode can be used to demonstrate DSF in a customer's Terraform Cloud account or the Imperva Terraform Cloud account, which is accessible for internal use (SEs, QA, Research, etc.), and can be used to deploy/undeploy POC environments on AWS accounts owned by Imperva.

If you want to use Imperva's Terraform Cloud account, the first thing to do is to request access here:
[Open Terraform Cloud Account - Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgJh4kXYRD08xDsFyYgaYsS3ebhVrBTWvntcMCutSf0kNV2w/viewform)

**NOTE:** Currently this deployment mode doesn't support customizing the chosen example's code.

1. **Connect to Terraform Cloud:** Connect to the desired Terraform Cloud account, either the internal Imperva account or a customer account if one is available.
2. **Create a new workspace:** Complete these steps to create a new workspace in Terraform Cloud that will be used for the DSF deployment.

**The Terraform Cloud Deployment is now complete and a functioning version of DSF is now available.**

## Installer Machine Deployment Mode

If a Linux machine is not available or DSFKit cannot be run locally for some reason, Imperva supports deployments via a DSFKit Installer Machine on AWS. This dedicated machine acts as a “bastion server”, and the user only needs to create a t2.medium EC2 machine and OS: RHEL-8.6.0_HVM-20220503-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2.

This can be done either manually or via an automated process. Select your preferred method and follow the instructions below.

**NOTE:** Currently this deployment mode doesn't support customizing the chosen example's code.

### Manual Installer Machine Deployment Mode

Complete these steps to manually create an installer machine:

1. **Launch an Instance:** Search for RHEL-8.6.0_HVM-20220503-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2 image and click “enter”:<br>![Launch an Instance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203822848-8dd8705d-3c91-4d7b-920a-b89dd9e0998a.png)


2. Choose the “Community AMI”:<br>![Community AMI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203825854-99287e5b-2d68-4a65-9b8b-40ae9a49c90b.png)


3. Select t2.medium 'Instance type'.


4. Create or select an existing 'Key pair' that you will later use to ssh to the installer machine. 


4. Expand the “Advanced details” panel:<br>![Advanced details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203825918-31879c4b-ca61-48e3-a522-c325335c4419.png)


5. Scroll down to find the “User data” input field. Copy and paste the contents of this [bash script](https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/blob/1.3.5/installer_machine/prepare_installer.tpl) into the [User data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) textbox.<br>![User data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203826003-661c829f-d704-43c4-adb7-854b8008577c.png)


6. Replace the following placeholders with their value in the bash code you pasted: (You can also do the replacements in a text editor and copy the result to the AWS console)
    1. ${example_name}: E.g., basic_deployment
    2. ${example_type}: poc or installation, according to where your example is located in the [DSFKit GitHub repository](https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.3.6) under the 'examples' directory.
    3. ${access_key}: AWS access key which provides access to the AWS account where you want to deploy DSF. 
    4. ${secret_key}: AWS secret key which provides access to the AWS account where you want to deploy DSF.
    5. ${region}: AWS region where you want to deploy DSF.
    6. ${web_console_cidr}: A list of CIDR blocks each surrounded by "" and separated by commas, which will allow DSF Hub web access once it is deployed. E.g., using ["0.0.0.0/0"] makes the Hub web console public. It is recommended to specify a more restricted IP and CIDR range.

7. Click on **Launch Instance**. At this stage, the Installer Machine is initializing and will automatically create all necessary resources (Hub, GWs, etc.). 

8. Run SSH to installer machine from your computer or another computer which has access to the installer machine:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ${key_pair_file} ec2-user@${installer_machine_public_ip}
   
   >>>> Replace the key_pair_file with the name of the file from step 4, and the installer_machine_public_ip with 
        the public IP of the installer machine which should now be available in the AWS EC2 console 
    ```
   
    **Note:** You may need to decrease the access privileges of the key_pair_file in order to be able to use it in for SSH. 
    For example: `chmode 400 ${key_pair_file}` 


9. View the progress in the logs by tailing the “user-data” log:
    ```bash
    tail -f /var/log/user-data.log
    ```
   This should take about 30 minutes.


10. When the deployment is completed, navigate to the directory which contains the example's Terraform files.
    For example:
    ```bash
    cd /${example_name}
    
    >>>> Use the name of the example you chose
    ```

11. When the deployment is completed, extract the web console password and DSF URL using:
     1. ```bash
        cd /${example_name}
       
        >>>> Use the name of the example you chose
        ```
     2. ```bash
         terraform output "dsf_hub_web_console"
         ```
12. Access the DSF Portal by entering the DSF public or private (up to you) URL into a web browser. Enter “admin” as the username and the admin_password as the password generated in the previous step.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not destroy the installer machine until you are done and have destroyed all other resources. Otherwise, there may be leftovers in your AWS account that will require manual deletion which is a tedious process. For more information see the [Manual Installer Machine Undeployment Mode](#manual-installer-machine-undeployment-mode) section.

**The Manual Installer Machine Deployment is now complete and a functioning version of DSF is now available.**

### Automated Installer Machine Deployment Mode

In case you don’t want to manually create the installer machine, you can automate its creation. DSFKit provides a Terraform recipe that automatically creates the installer machine with the required [user data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html).

Complete the following instructions to automate the creation of an installer machine which in turn automatically installs DSF.

1. Download the Terraform recipe zip [here](https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.3.6/installer_machine/installer_machine.zip).


2. Unzip the zip file in CLI or using your operating system's UI.
   For example, in CLI:
   ```bash
   unzip installer_machine.zip
   ```

3. In CLI, navigate to the directory which contains the Terraform files.
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd installer_machine
   ```

4. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

5. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```
   You will be prompted to input the AWS access key, AWS secret key and AWS region variables.
   At this stage, the Installer Machine is initializing and will automatically create all necessary resources (Hub, GWs, etc.).

   This should take a few minutes.


7. After the first phase of the deployment is completed, it outputs the following SSH commands, for example:

    ```bash
    installer_machine_ssh_command = "ssh -i ssh_keys/dsf_ssh_key-default ec2-user@3.69.20.130"
    logs_tail_ssh_command = "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking='no' -i ssh_keys/dsf_ssh_key-default ec2-user@3.69.20.130 -C 'sudo tail -f /var/log/user-data.log'"    
    ```

8. The second and last phase of the deployment runs in the background. To follow it and know when it is completed run the `logs_tail_ssh_command` which appears in the first phase output.


9. After the deployment is completed, run ssh to the installer machine using the `installer_machine_ssh_command` which appears in the first phase output.


10. Navigate to the directory of the example you chose.
    For example:
     ```bash
     cd /dsfkit/examples/poc/basic_deployment
     
     >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
     ```

12. Extract the web console admin password and DSF URL using:
    ```bash
    terraform output "dsf_hub_web_console"
    ```
13. Access the DSF Hub by entering the DSF URL into a web browser. Enter “admin” as the username and the admin_password as the password outputted in the previous step. 

**NOTE:** The Terraform script is OS-Safe, as it doesn't run any bash script.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not destroy the installer machine until you are done and have destroyed all other resources. Otherwise, there may be leftovers in your AWS account that will require manual deletion which is a tedious process. For more information see the [Automated Installer Machine Undeployment Mode](#automated-installer-machine-undeployment-mode) section.

**The Automated Installer Machine Deployment is now complete and a functioning version of DSF is now available.**

# Out-of-the-box Examples

DSFKit provides a number of out-of-the-box examples which are already configured to deploy common DSF environments.

These examples can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.3.6">DSFKit GitHub Repository</a> under the <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.3.6/examples">examples</a> directory.
Some examples are intended for Lab or POC and others for actual DSF deployments by Professional Services and customers.

For more details about each example, click on the example name.

# IAM Roles

To be able to create AWS resources inside any AWS Account, you need to provide an AWS User with the required permissions in order to run DSFKit Terraform.
The permissions are separated to 3 different policies. Use the relevant policies according to your needs:

1. For general required permissions such as create an EC2, security group, etc., use the permissions specified here -  [general required permissions](/permissions_samples/GeneralRequiredPermissions.txt).
2. In order to create network resources such as VPC, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway etc., use the permissions specified here - [create network resources permissions](/permissions_samples/CreateNetworkResourcesPermissions.txt).
3. In order to onboard a MySQL RDS with CloudWatch configured, use the permissions specified here - [onboard MySQL RDS permissions](/permissions_samples/OnboardMysqlRdsPermissions.txt).
4. In order to onboard a MsSQL RDS with audit configured and with synthetic data, use the permissions specified here - [onboard MsSQL RDS with synthetic data permissions](/permissions_samples/OnboardMssqlRdsWithDataPermissions.txt).

**NOTE:** The permissions specified in option 2 are irrelevant for customers who prefer to use their own network objects, such as VPC, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, etc.

# Undeployment

Depending on the deployment mode you chose, follow the undeployment instructions of the same mode to completely remove Imperva DSF from AWS.

The undeployment process should be followed whether the deployment was successful or not. 
In case of failure, the Terraform may have deployed some resources before failing, and want these removed.

## CLI Undeployment Mode

1. Navigate to the directory which contains the Terraform files.
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd basic_deployment
   
   >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
   ```

2. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
    ```

## Terraform Cloud Undeployment Mode

1. To undeploy the DSF deployment, click on Settings and find "Destruction and Deletion" from the navigation menu to open the "Destroy infrastructure" page. Ensure that the "Allow destroy plans" toggle is selected, and click on the Queue Destroy Plan button to begin.<br>![Destroy Plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203826129-6957bb53-b824-4f7a-8bbd-b44c17a5a3c4.png)

2. The DSF deployment is now destroyed and the workspace may be re-used if needed. If this workspace is not being re-used, it may be removed with “Force delete from Terraform Cloud” that can be found under Settings.<br>![delete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203826179-de7a6c1d-31a1-419d-9c71-61c96cfb7d2e.png)

**NOTE:** Do not remove the workspace before the deployment is completely destroyed. Doing so may lead to leftovers in your AWS account that will require manual deletion which is a tedious process.

## Installer Machine Undeployment Mode

### Manual Installer Machine Undeployment Mode

1. Run SSH to installer machine from your computer or another computer which has access to the installer machine:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ${key_pair_file} ec2-user@${installer_machine_public_ip}
   
   >>>> Fill the values of the key_pair_file and installer_machine_public_ip placeholders (See <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.3.6#manual-installer-machine-deployment-mode">)  
    ```

2. ```bash
   cd /${example_name}
   
   >>>> Use the name of the example you chose
   ```
3. Run:
    ```bash
    sudo su
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${access_key}
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${secret_key}
    export AWS_REGION=${region}
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
   
    >>>> Fill the values of the access_key, secret_key and region placeholders with the 
         AWS access key, secert key and region that you used in the deployement
    ```

4. Wait for the environment to be destroyed.


5. Terminate the EC2 installer machine via the AWS Console.

### Automated Installer Machine Undeployment Mode

1. Run ssh to the installer machine using the `installer_machine_ssh_command` which appears in the first phase output of the [Automated Installer Machine Deployment Mode](#automated-installer-machine-deployment-mode).


2. ```bash
   cd /${example_name}
   
   >>>> Use the name of the example you chose
   ```
   
3. Run:
    ```bash
    sudo su
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${access_key}
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${secret_key}
    export AWS_REGION=${region}
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
   
    >>>> Fill the values of the access_key, secret_key and region placeholders with the 
         AWS access key, secert key and region that you used in the deployement
    ```

4. Wait for the environment to be destroyed.
   
   This should take a few minutes.

6. Exit from the Installer Machine.

7. On the local machine:
   ```bash
   cd installer_machine
   ```
8. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
    ```
