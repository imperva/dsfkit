# DSFKit

Imperva DSFKit is the official Terraform toolkit designed to automate the deployment of Imperva's Data Security Fabric.
The DSF can be easily deployed by following the steps in this guide which are currently available for deployments on AWS only.

Currently, the DSFKit supports deployment of the DSF Hub & Agentless Gateway (formerly Sonar), and DAM.
In the near future, DSFKit will enable you to deploy the full suite of DSF sub-products, including DRA, and will support the other major public clouds.

# Getting Ready to Deploy

## Choosing the Deployment Mode

DSFKit offers several deployment modes:

* **CLI Deployment Mode:** This mode offers a straightforward deployment option that relies on running a Terraform script on the deployment client's machine which must be a Linux machine.

  For more details, refer to [CLI Deployment Mode](#cli-deployment-mode).
* **Terraform Cloud Deployment Mode:** This mode makes use of Terraform Cloud, a service that exposes a dedicated UI to create and destroy resources via Terraform.
  This mode can  be used in case we don't want to install any software on the deployment client's machine. It can be used to demo DSF on an Imperva AWS Account or on a customer’s AWS account (if the customer supplies credentials).

  For more details, refer to [Terraform Cloud Deployment Mode](#terraform-cloud-deployment-mode).
* **Installer Machine Deployment Mode:** This mode is similar to the CLI mode except that the Terraform is run on an EC2 machine which the user creates, instead of on the deployment client's machine. This mode can be used if a Linux machine is not available, or DSFKit cannot be run on the available Linux machine, e.g., since it does not have permissions to access the deployment environment.

  For more details, refer to [Installer Machine Deployment Mode](#installer-machine-deployment-mode).

The first step in the deployment is to choose the deployment mode most appropriate to you.
If you need more information to decide on your preferred mode, refer to the detailed instructions for each mode [here](#deployment).

## Prerequisites

Before using DSFKit to deploy DSF, it is necessary to complete the following steps:

1. Create an AWS User with secret and access keys which comply with the required IAM permissions (see [IAM Role section](#iam-roles)).
2. The deployment requires access to the tarball containing the Sonar binaries. The tarball is located in a dedicated AWS S3 bucket owned by Imperva. 
   [Click here to request access to download this file](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnVaw48FlElP9Po_36LLsZELsanzpVnt8J08nymBqHuX_ddA/viewform).  
3. Only if you chose the [CLI Deployment Mode](#cli-deployment-mode), download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
4. Only if you chose the [CLI Deployment Mode](#cli-deployment-mode), download Terraform [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads). It is recommended on MacOS systems to use the "Package Manager" option during installation.
5. Latest Supported Terraform Version: 1.4.x. Using a higher version may result in unexpected behavior or errors.


**NOTE:** It may take several hours for the access to be granted to AWS and Terraform Cloud in Steps 2 and 3.

## Choosing the Example/Recipe that Fits Your Use Case

An important thing to understand about the DSF deployment, is that there are many variations on what can be deployed, 
e.g., the number of Agentless Gateways, with or without HADR, the number of VPCs, etc.

We provide several of out-of-the-box Terraform recipes we call "examples" which are already configured to deploy common DSF environments.
You can use the example as is, or customize it to accommodate your deployment requirements.

These examples can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.4.3">DSFKit GitHub Repository</a> under the <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.4.3/examples">examples</a> directory.
Some examples are intended for Lab or POC and others for actual DSF deployments by Professional Services and customers.

For more details about each example, click on the example name.

If you are familiar with Terraform, you can go over the example code and see what it consists of.
The examples make use of the building blocks of the DSFKit - the modules, which can be found in the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/search/modules?namespace=imperva&q=dsf-">Imperva Terraform Modules Registry</a>. As a convention, the DSFKit modules' names have a 'dsf' prefix.

Feel free to [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3_IoAtuIyLUf9crqXiJwo540iuTZ9l0K1I-uQ-CXRbZL7xA/viewform) if you need help choosing or customizing an example to suit your needs. 

## Binaries Location and Versioning

When using DSFKit there is no need to manually download the DSF binaries, DSFKit will do that automatically based on the Sonar and DAM versions specified in the Terraform example.

The latest DSF version, Q1 2023, is recommended.
This includes the following version of the DSF sub-products:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>DSF Sub-Product</strong>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Recommended Version</strong>
    </td>
    <td><strong>Supported Versions</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sonar</td><td>v4.11</td><td>4.9 and higher</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>DAM</td><td>v14.11.1.10</td><td>TBD</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**For example**: examples/poc/basic_deployment/variables.tf
   ```terraform
   variable "sonar_version" {
       type    = string
       default = "4.11"
   }

   >>>> Change the Sonar version to the one you want to install
   ```

Make sure that the version you are using is supported by all the modules which are part of your deployment.
To see which versions are supported by each module, refer to the specific module's README. 
(For example, [DSF Hub module's README](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/imperva/dsf-hub/aws/latest))

# Deployment 

After you have [chosen the deployment mode](#choosing-the-deployment-mode), follow the step-by-step instructions below to ensure a successful deployment. If you have any questions or issues during the deployment process, please contact [Imperva Technical Support](https://support.imperva.com/s/).

## CLI Deployment Mode

As mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), the DSF deployment requires access to the tarball containing the Sonar binaries. The tarball is located in a dedicated AWS S3 bucket owned by Imperva.
[Click here to request access to download this file](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnVaw48FlElP9Po_36LLsZELsanzpVnt8J08nymBqHuX_ddA/viewform).

This mode makes use of the Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI) to deploy and manage environments.
Terraform CLI uses a bash script and therefore requires a Linux/Mac machine.

The first thing to do in this deployment mode is to [download Terraform ](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).

**NOTE:** Update the values for the required parameters to complete the installation: example_name, aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key and region

1. Download the zip file of the example you've chosen (See the [Choosing the Example/Recipe that Fits Your Use Case](#choosing-the-examplerecipe-that-fits-your-use-case) section) from the <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.4.3">DSFKit GitHub Repository</a>, e.g., if you choose the "basic_deployment" example, you should download <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.4.3/examples/poc/basic_deployment/basic_deployment.zip">basic_deployment.zip</a>.

2. Unzip the zip file in CLI or using your operating system's UI.
   For example, in CLI:
   ```bash
   unzip basic_deployment.zip
   
   >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
   ```

3. In CLI, navigate to the directory which contains the Terraform files.
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd basic_deployment
   
   >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
   ```

4. Optionally make changes to the example's Terraform code to fit your use case. If you need help doing that, please contact [Imperva Technical Support](https://support.imperva.com/s/).


4. Terraform uses the AWS shell environment for AWS authentication. More details on how to authenticate with AWS are [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).  \
   For simplicity, in this example we will use environment variables:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${access_key}
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${secret_key}
    export AWS_REGION=${region}

    >>>> Fill the values of the access_key, secret_key and region placeholders, e.g., export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=5J5AVVNNHYY4DM6ZJ5N46.
    ```

5. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
6. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

   This should take about 30 minutes.


7. Extract the web console admin password and DSF URL using:
    ```bash
    terraform output "dsf_hub_web_console"
    ```
8. Access the DSF Hub by entering the DSF URL into a web browser. Enter “admin” as the username and the admin_password as the password outputted in the previous step.

**The CLI Deployment is now complete and a functioning version of DSF is now available.**

## Terraform Cloud Deployment Mode

As mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), the DSF deployment requires access to the tarball containing the Sonar binaries. The tarball is located in a dedicated AWS S3 bucket owned by Imperva.
[Click here to request access to download this file](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnVaw48FlElP9Po_36LLsZELsanzpVnt8J08nymBqHuX_ddA/viewform).

This deployment mode uses the Terraform Cloud service, which allows deploying and managing deployments via a dedicated UI. Deploying the environment is easily triggered by clicking a button within the Terraform interface, which then pulls the required code from the Imperva GitHub repository and automatically runs the scripts remotely. 

This deployment mode can be used to demonstrate DSF in a customer's Terraform Cloud account or the Imperva Terraform Cloud account, which is accessible for internal use (SEs, QA, Research, etc.), and can be used to deploy/undeploy POC environments on AWS accounts owned by Imperva.

 It is required that you have access to a Terraform Cloud account. Any account may be used, whether the account is owned by Imperva or the customer. [Click here to request access to Imperva's Terraform Cloud account](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgJh4kXYRD08xDsFyYgaYsS3ebhVrBTWvntcMCutSf0kNV2w/viewform).

If you want to use Imperva's Terraform Cloud account, the first thing to do is to request access here:
[Open Terraform Cloud Account - Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgJh4kXYRD08xDsFyYgaYsS3ebhVrBTWvntcMCutSf0kNV2w/viewform).
**Our internal Terraform Cloud account can only be used for demo purposes and not for customer deployments**.

**NOTE:** Currently this deployment mode doesn't support customizing the chosen example's code.

1. **Connect to Terraform Cloud:** Connect to the desired Terraform Cloud account, either the internal Imperva account or a customer account if one is available.
2. **Create a new workspace:** Complete these steps to create a new workspace in Terraform Cloud that will be used for the DSF deployment. 
    * Click the **+ New workspace** button in the top navigation bar to open the **Create a new Workspace** page.<br>![New Workspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52969528/212976777-f3095813-baa6-4ece-aba2-29b39001aa48.png)

**The Terraform Cloud Deployment is now complete and a functioning version of DSF is now available.**

## Installer Machine Deployment Mode

As mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), the DSF deployment requires access to the tarball containing the Sonar binaries. The tarball is located in a dedicated AWS S3 bucket owned by Imperva.
[Click here to request access to download this file](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnVaw48FlElP9Po_36LLsZELsanzpVnt8J08nymBqHuX_ddA/viewform).

This mode is similar to the CLI mode except that the Terraform is run on an EC2 machine which the user creates, instead of on the deployment client's machine. This mode can be used if a Linux machine is not available, or DSFKit cannot be run on the available Linux machine, e.g., since it does not have permissions to access the deployment environment.

1. In AWS, choose a region for the installer machine while keeping in mind that the machine should have access to the DSF environment that you want to deploy, and preferably be in proximity to it.  


2. **Launch an Instance:** Search for RHEL-8.6.0_HVM-20220503-x86_64-2-Hourly2-GP2 image and click “enter”:<br>![Launch an Instance](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203822848-8dd8705d-3c91-4d7b-920a-b89dd9e0998a.png)


3. Choose the “Community AMI”:<br>![Community AMI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203825854-99287e5b-2d68-4a65-9b8b-40ae9a49c90b.png)


4. Select t2.medium 'Instance type', or t3.medium if T2 is not available in the region.


5. Create or select an existing 'Key pair' that you will later use to run SSH to the installer machine. 


6. In the Network settings panel - make your configurations while keeping in mind that the installer machine should have access to the DSF environment that you want to deploy, and that the deployment's client machine should have access to the installer machine.


7. Expand the “Advanced details” panel:<br>![Advanced details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203825918-31879c4b-ca61-48e3-a522-c325335c4419.png)


8. Copy and paste the contents of this [bash script](https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/blob/1.4.3/installer_machine/installer_machine_user_data.sh) into the [User data](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html) textbox.<br>![User data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203826003-661c829f-d704-43c4-adb7-854b8008577c.png)


9. Click on **Launch Instance**. At this stage, the installer machine is initializing and downloading the necessary dependencies.


10. When launching is completed, run SSH to the installer machine from the deployment client's machine:
     ```bash
     ssh -i ${key_pair_file} ec2-user@${installer_machine_public_ip}
   
    >>>> Replace the key_pair_file with the name of the file from step 4, and the installer_machine_public_ip with 
         the public IP of the installer machine which should now be available in the AWS EC2 console.
         E.g., ssh -i a_key_pair.pem ec2-user@1.2.3.4
     ```
   
     **NOTE:** You may need to decrease the access privileges of the key_pair_file in order to be able to use it in for ssh. 
     For example: `chmode 400 a_key_pair.pem` 


11. Download the zip file of the example you've chosen (See the [Choosing the Example/Recipe that Fits Your Use Case](#choosing-the-examplerecipe-that-fits-your-use-case) section) from the <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.4.3">DSFKit GitHub Repository</a>, e.g., if you choose the "basic_deployment" example, you should download <a href="https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/tree/1.4.3/examples/poc/basic_deployment/basic_deployment.zip">basic_deployment.zip</a>.
    Run:
    ```bash
    wget https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/raw/1.4.3/examples/poc/basic_deployment/basic_deployment.zip
    
    or
    
    wget https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/raw/1.4.3/examples/poc/hadr_deployment/hadr_deployment.zip
    
    or
 
    wget https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/raw/1.4.3/examples/installation/single_account_deployment/single_account_deployment.zip
    
    or
 
    wget https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/raw/1.4.3/examples/installation/multi_account_deployment/multi_account_deployment.zip
    
    or
 
    wget https://github.com/imperva/dsfkit/raw/1.4.3/examples/alpha/dam_basic_deployment/dam_basic_deployment.zip
    ```

12. Unzip the zip file:
    ```bash
    unzip basic_deployment.zip

    >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
    ```

13. Continue by following the [CLI Deployment Mode](#cli-deployment-mode) beginning at step 3.

**IMPORTANT:** Do not destroy the installer machine until you are done and have destroyed all other resources. Otherwise, there may be leftovers in your AWS account that will require manual deletion which is a tedious process. For more information see the [Installer Machine Undeployment Mode](#installer-machine-undeployment-mode) section.

**The Installer Machine Deployment is now completed and a functioning version of DSF is now available.**

# IAM Roles

To be able to create AWS resources inside any AWS Account, you need to provide an AWS User with the required permissions in order to run DSFKit Terraform.
The permissions are separated to different policies. Use the relevant policies according to your needs:

1. For general required permissions such as create an EC2, security group, etc., use the permissions specified here -  [general required permissions](/permissions_samples/GeneralRequiredPermissions.txt).
2. In order to create network resources such as VPC, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway etc., use the permissions specified here - [create network resources permissions](/permissions_samples/CreateNetworkResourcesPermissions.txt).
3. In order to onboard a MySQL RDS with CloudWatch configured, use the permissions specified here - [onboard MySQL RDS permissions](/permissions_samples/OnboardMysqlRdsPermissions.txt).
4. In order to onboard a MsSQL RDS with audit configured and with synthetic data, use the permissions specified here - [onboard MsSQL RDS with synthetic data permissions](/permissions_samples/OnboardMssqlRdsWithDataPermissions.txt).

Please note that when running the deployment with a custom 'deployment_name' variable, you should ensure that the corresponding condition in the AWS permissions of the user who runs the deployment reflects the new custom variable.</br></br>
**NOTE:** The permissions specified in option 2 are irrelevant for customers who prefer to use their own network objects, such as VPC, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway, etc.

# Undeployment

Depending on the deployment mode you chose, follow the undeployment instructions of the same mode to completely remove Imperva DSF from AWS.

The undeployment process should be followed whether the deployment was successful or not. 
In case of failure, the Terraform may have deployed some resources before failing, and want these removed.

## CLI Undeployment Mode

1. Navigate to the directory which contains the Terraform files.
   For example:
   ```bash
   cd basic_deployment
   
   >>>> Change this command depending on the example you chose
   ```
2. Terraform uses the AWS shell environment for AWS authentication. More details on how to authenticate with AWS are [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).  \
   For simplicity, in this example we will use environment variables:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${access_key}
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${secret_key}
    export AWS_REGION=${region}

    >>>> Fill the values of the access_key, secret_key and region placeholders, e.g., export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=5J5AVVNNHYY4DM6ZJ5N46.
    ```
   
3. Run:
    ```bash
    terraform destroy -auto-approve
    ```

## Terraform Cloud Undeployment Mode

1. To undeploy the DSF deployment, click on Settings and find "Destruction and Deletion" from the navigation menu to open the "Destroy infrastructure" page. Ensure that the "Allow destroy plans" toggle is selected, and click on the Queue Destroy Plan button to begin.<br>![Destroy Plan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203826129-6957bb53-b824-4f7a-8bbd-b44c17a5a3c4.png)

2. The DSF deployment is now destroyed and the workspace may be re-used if needed. If this workspace is not being re-used, it may be removed with “Force delete from Terraform Cloud” that can be found under Settings.<br>![delete](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87799317/203826179-de7a6c1d-31a1-419d-9c71-61c96cfb7d2e.png)

**NOTE:** Do not remove the workspace before the deployment is completely destroyed. Doing so may lead to leftovers in your AWS account that will require manual deletion which is a tedious process.

## Installer Machine Undeployment Mode

1. Run SSH to installer machine from the deployment client's machine:
    ```bash
    ssh -i ${key_pair_file} ec2-user@${installer_machine_public_ip}
   
   >>>> Fill the values of the key_pair_file and installer_machine_public_ip placeholders  
    ```

2. Continue by following the [CLI Undeployment Mode](#cli-undeployment-mode) steps.


3. Wait for the environment to be destroyed.


4. Terminate the EC2 installer machine via the AWS Console.
