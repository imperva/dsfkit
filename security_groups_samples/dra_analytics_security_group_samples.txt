Allow access from DRA Admin:

- TCP port 8443 from DRA Admin IP ranges

Allow access from the DSF Hub:

- TPC port 22 from the DSF Hub IP ranges
- TCP port 22 from the DSF Hub public IP if exits

Allow access from the Agent Gateway for legacy deployment:

- TCP port 22 from Agent Gateway IP ranges


Notes:

* You may need to run a gradual deployment since the DSF Hub public IP is not known before running the deployment
* If DSF Hub HADR is configured, include main and DR nodes' information
* If Agentless Gateway HADR is configured, include main and DR nodes' information
